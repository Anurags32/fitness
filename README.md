## 🎯 Approach & Thought Process

### 1. **Architecture Decision**

- **MVVM Pattern**: Separated business logic from UI using Provider for state management
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access layer for better testability
- **Component-Based UI**: Created reusable widgets for consistency

### 2. **Responsive Design Strategy**

- **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed for mobile, then adapted for larger screens
- **Breakpoint System**: Implemented custom breakpoints (mobile: <600px, tablet: 600-1024px, desktop: >1024px)
- **Flexible Layouts**: Used responsive utilities for padding, margins, and grid systems

### 3. **User Experience Focus**

- **Progressive Loading**: Implemented beautiful loading states for images
- **Visual Feedback**: Added animations and micro-interactions
- **Accessibility**: Ensured proper contrast ratios and semantic widgets

### 4. **Code Quality & Testing**

- **Clean Code**: Followed Flutter best practices and naming conventions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Wrote widget tests for critical user flows
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling with user-friendly messages
